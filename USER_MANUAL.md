Introduction:
In today's education landscape, student connectivity and awareness are crucial. Many face challenges like isolation and inadequate support, impacting their academic performance and school experience. It's concerning that some lack avenues for help due to limited networks, fostering isolation and hindering academic progress.

SPECS addresses these issues with the "Clique" app, utilizing available resources to ensure student success. Without access to information or awareness of school events, students may feel disconnected and disengaged. "Clique" provides a platform for students to access newsletters, announcements, and seek answers, promoting clarity and community engagement. By fostering open communication, "Clique" enhances student satisfaction and involvement in school life.
